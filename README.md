## Description

This is a my programmer portfolio site, built with React. Contains a landing page, which doubles as the About Me. Also includes a portfolio page with several links to various programming projects I've created for bootcamp. There is also a link to a resume which will need updating as well as a contact page that will need to connect to the backend.
